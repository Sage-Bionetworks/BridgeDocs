    The unit of measurement being used for a numeric value when it is expressing something like 
    a duration, weight, or length. **Important:** the unit given in a survey question must be the 
    unit of the data as it is sent to Bridge, regardless of how the value is collected. For example, 
    you can collect height in feet and inches, but if the unit of the question is meters, you must 
    send the value converted to meters. **The unit is part of the exported data set.**
